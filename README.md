# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP
A complete end-to-end NLP project to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**, using text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing can be used to detect misinformation. It covers the full pipeline:
- Data loading & labeling
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training (Multinomial Naive Bayes)
- Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Metrics)
- Error analysis

Final model accuracy: **93.7%**
